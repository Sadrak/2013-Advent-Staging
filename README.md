# Perl Catalyst Advent Calendar - 2012

It's time again for this year's [Catalyst Advent Calendar](http://www.catalystframework.org/calendar/2013/)! 

## How to write an article?

The Catalyst Advent Calendar is using the [POD](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html) format. 
For each day of the month there is a corresponding pod file into the `root` directory.
If you don't feel comfortable to write the article using the POD format, don't worry. 
Into the `examples/` directory of this repository there are few examples from previous years.

If you have any ideas, questions or you need help with your article you can always join IRC [click here to start instant web chat](http://chat.mibbit.com/#catalyst@irc.perl.org).
