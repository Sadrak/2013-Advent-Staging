<h1 id="Reflections---5.90-and-beyond">2011 Reflections - 5.90 and beyond.</h1>

<p>Uh-oh, December 1st - time does indeed fly, and it&#39;s time to recap what has happened in our-favourite-web-framework-land.</p>

<p>It is my honour to start off this year&#39;s Advent Calendar with a recap about what&#39;s happened in the last 12 months in Catalyst land, and what&#39;s coming up in the next 12 months.</p>

<h2 id="The-Past">The Past</h2>

<p>Catalyst has been around for quite a while now (I&#39;ve been using it for over 5 years, and I still feel like a newbie at times). I&#39;m going to spare you a lengthy history lesson, however this time last year, we were still talking about the cool things you could do with version 5.80.</p>

<p>In the last year, we&#39;ve released the next major version of Catalyst, version 5.90001 (and we&#39;ve since released another 6 minor releases). Unusually for a major release, 5.90001 contains <b>less</b> code than the last major release of Catalyst 5.80 (5.80033).. By 88 lines.</p>

<p>Hmmm, that statistic was a little less impressive than I was hoping for when I went to find it...</p>

<p>The point I was looking to make was that we lost a massive amount of code (and the associated maintenance burden, by removing all the Catalyst::Engine code, and replacing it with <a>Plack</a>).</p>

<p>A more real comparison would be to look at the diffstat for these engine classes:</p>

<pre><code>    lib/Catalyst/Engine.pm         |  247 +++++++++++++---
    lib/Catalyst/Engine/CGI.pm     |  328 --------------------
    lib/Catalyst/Engine/FastCGI.pm |  663 ----------------------------------------
    lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm    |  579 -----------------------------------
    lib/Catalyst/EngineLoader.pm   |  159 ++++++++++</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s over eleven hundred lines of code removed. Quite a significant reduction!</p>

<p>The reason the &#39;real&#39; change is much much lower, is, of course that doing this port has involved the addition of a significant quantity of tests and a not insignificant amount of documentation about upgrading.</p>

<p>So, the core of Catalyst lost code, and that makes it nicer for the Catalyst developers..</p>

<p>But how is that interesting for users?</p>

<p>Well, you can now add a <code>.psgi</code> file to your Catalyst application, and then take advantage of any Plack middleware you&#39;d like to. This means that you can do anything from arranging for your static files to get concatenated automatically, to mounting entire sub-applications within or alongside your app.</p>

<p>It also means that a much greater choice of web server engines is possible than ever before, as any Plack server can be used. See <a>Catalyst::PSGI</a> for further details.</p>

<p>This includes asynchronous servers, and brings us to the present:</p>

<h2 id="The-Present">The Present</h2>

<p>The 5.90 series is now nicely stabilised, and we&#39;ve been actually implementing a set of long promised deprecations and removals to keep things moving forwards (by reducing and cleaning up old code).</p>

<p>We&#39;re currently working on refactoring the internals to move state from the engine into the request, which will enable us to handle requests entirely asynchronously. This code should be in a TRIAL release near you within the next few days, and I&#39;m hoping to be able to write a further advent article about asynchronous Catalyst.</p>

<p>In parallel with this, this year&#39;s Google summer of code project has produced the next development branch, which nicely leads onto:</p>

<h2 id="The-Future">The Future</h2>

<p>The next major version of Catalyst is planning to concentrate on improving the limited component loading facilities within Catalyst currently.</p>

<p>Catalyst <b>is</b> extremely pluggable, and one of it&#39;s more powerful features is the ability to customise the component loading process.</p>

<p>By default, we write components outside the application, and bind them in using <a>Catalyst::Model::Adaptor</a> (or the lower level <code>COMPONENT</code> hook if you&#39;d prefer to do it manually). You can further customise things per request with components such as <a>Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext</a> (or by using the lower level <code>ACCEPT_CONTEXT</code> hook if preferred).</p>

<p>This gives you an amazing amount of flexibility, but in many ways it fails to be obvious and declarative enough. If you want to have multiple components in your application that depend on each other, then your choices are to either manually hack to component load order (so they&#39;re initialised in the correct sequence), or to make them all &#39;per request&#39;.</p>

<p>The new branch makes this all much more declearative by outsourcing all of the inversion of control code out to <a>Bread::Board</a>. Using the planned new sugar syntax, you&#39;ll be able to declare dependencies in your application like this:</p>

<pre><code>    container {
        model {
            component &#39;Foo&#39; =&gt; (
                    class        =&gt; &#39;Foo&#39;,
                    lifecycle    =&gt; &#39;PerRequest&#39;,
                    dependencies =&gt; {
                        config(),
                        bar =&gt; depends_on(&#39;Bar&#39;),
                    }
            );
            component &#39;Bar&#39; =&gt; (
                    class        =&gt; &#39;Bar&#39;,
                    lifecycle    =&gt; &#39;Singleton&#39;,
            );
        };
    };</code></pre>

<p>And, of course, if you want or need to - you&#39;ll be able to override and customise the component loading process in a pluggable way, so whilst common problems will become much easier (and cleaner) to solve, a lot more power will be available to those who need it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been an exciting last year, and it&#39;s going to be an exciting year ahead for Catalyst.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
